## Benefits of the Magento Google Tag Manager
The Magento 2 Google Tag Manager extension creates an uncomplicated environment for data tracking and brings multiple benefits:

### Implement tracking tags in a matter of minutes
Enabling Google Tag Manager tags usually requires you to insert the GTM tracking script into your website's source code manually. That’s way too tedious a task that takes longer than you’d like.

With the Google Tag Manager extension, you won’t have to do any of that.

Just enter the tracking IDs directly in the admin panel and generate the datalayer in one click. Then, import the GTM container with all the tags and triggers ready. 

No need to edit code and waste days setting up the events. We’ve got you fully covered.

</p>

### Monitor Every Customer Journey Step
Tracking customers’ behaviour is essential for detecting patterns and spotting bottlenecks. What seems insignificant may be a real dealbreaker, and you have to know where exactly things don’t go as expected.

With this Google Tag Manager extension for Magento, you get to track every step your customers take: from landing on your website to making a purchase or leaving your website without placing an order. 

This info gives you valuable insights into things that work and things that have to be optimized.

</p>

### Know Exactly What Your Top-Performing Products Are
What are your biggest traffic and revenue generators? What products do not perform as well as you expected? 

Use this Magento 2 Google Tag Manager extension to track what products get the most views, are purchased, added to the cart, wishlist, and removed from the cart the most often. 

Stop guessing and cut right to the chase. Establish a strategy that allows you to increase conversions and promote products that are falling behind in sales.

### Track Every Single Purchase
Ad blockers, browser restrictions, and strict privacy settings often stand in the way of accurate data tracking. That’s where missing purchases start to seep in and disrupt the picture you have in Google Analytics.

This Magento 2 Google Tag Manager has a solution, though. Set up the server-side tracking using the Measurement Protocol or the GTM server container to not miss a single conversion.

Track only missing purchases or opt for the fully server-side setup to close the gaps and get complete data.

</p>

### Boost Your Google Ads Campaigns
Google Ads campaigns are effective as long as you have relevant data to build them upon. That’s how you know exactly what products to promote and who your efforts have to be aimed at. 

This Magento Google Tag Manager extension offers a low-effort solution with high-value results. Set up the tracking in a couple of clicks and get valuable insights into your ads’ performance and user engagement.

Spot common patterns, see what’s working best, and retarget the campaigns that don’t work as expected.

</p>

### Stay GDPR and Consent Mode Compliant 
In the rush to track as much data as possible, it’s crucial to mind privacy regulations. They are obligatory in many countries, so you’d want to stay compliant.

The Magento 2 Google Tag Manager extension effectively collects data while staying GDPR and Google Consent Mode-compliant. It also fully supports the Magento 2 Cookie Consent extension by Magefan and other consent solutions. 

Thus, this extension ensures effective but safe data tracking.

### Keep Your Website Speed Up to Mark
Website speed matters as much as the versatile catalog and intuitive interface. So, it’s important to keep that aspect in check when adding more tracking scripts. 

This is something the Magento 2 Google Tag Manager extension covers out of the box. It inserts the tracking scripts without a negative impact on your website speed and performance. 

Why choose between performance and data tracking when you can have both?

### Set Up a Long-Lasting Solution
When setting up a tracking solution, it’s important to ensure it’s flexible, reliable, and can stay with you for the time to come. 

The Magento 2 Google Tag Manager extension supports your business growth and changes. It integrates seamlessly with custom GTM loaders, headless storefront, and Hyva frontend and checkout, leaving you space for future advancements. 

Integrate this solution, knowing that it won’t cause you headaches in the future but will be a reliable tool to support your growth.
